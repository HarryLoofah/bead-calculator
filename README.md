bead-counter
============

A simple Python project to help peyote stitch beadworkers to start their project. 

BeadCounter checks to make sure that the number of beads used in the project will 
work mathematically and lets the beadworker know what design elements will be possible
for the number of starting beads entered. 

##To Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Meansure the object that you'll be beading by stringing beads and wrapping thread around the object.
3. Enter the number of beads from the initial measurement around the object.
4. BeadCounter tells you if that number of beads will work, and if it doesn't, BeadCounter
suggests an alternative number or numbers to start with. 

BeadCounter also tells the beadworker how many bead to string, how many to add (when the first two lines
of beads are added to the project), and what long and short side design elements will be available.
